                NARRATOR:
                (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
                According to all known laws
                of aviation,
                :
                there is no way a bee
                should be able to fly.
                :
                Its wings are too small to get
                its fat little body off the ground.
                :
                The bee, of course, flies anyway
                :
                because bees don't care
                what humans think is impossible.
                BARRY BENSON:
                (Barry is picking out a shirt)
                Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                :
                Ooh, black and yellow!
                Let's shake it up a little.
                JANET BENSON:
                Barry! Breakfast is ready!
                BARRY:
                Coming!
                :
                Hang on a second.
                (Barry uses his antenna like a phone)
                :
                Hello?
                ADAM FLAYMAN:

                (Through phone)
                - Barry?
                BARRY:
                - Adam?
                ADAM:
                - Can you believe this is happening?
                BARRY:
                - I can't. I'll pick you up.
                (Barry flies down the stairs)
                :
                MARTIN BENSON:
                Looking sharp.
                JANET:
                Use the stairs. Your father
                paid good money for those.
                BARRY:
                Sorry. I'm excited.
                MARTIN:
                Here's the graduate.
                We're very proud of you, son.
