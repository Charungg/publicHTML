                <h2> Practical's Experience: </h2>

                <h3> <u> Positive </u> </h3>
                <p> My experience with <em> CS11010 </em> is fairly positive. <br>
                    The practical's worksheet was fairly challenging and well explained and structured, <br>
                    it was clearly shown each worksheet was building on previously foundation. <br>
                    Lecture was well explained and the example website helped me a lot <br>
                    because I could analyse them and implement them to my websites. <br>
                    Demonstaters and lecture's communcation about practical sheet was well informed.

                <h3> <u> Negative </u> </h3>  
                <p> In my opinion the best way to learn HTML are practical worksheet <br>
                    because they are designed for us students to tackle new concepts of HTML <br>
                    whereas lectures only gives us an idea how it works which is why I think <br>
                    instead of one practical worksheet it should be two a fortnight in place of lectures. <br>
                    <br>
                    Another problem I had was practicals and lectures not being linked, for example early <br>
                    on lectures about CSS also had CSS specific practical worksheet given on the same week. <br>
                    Whereas later on we was given JavaScript worksheets which was taught in previous weeks. <br>
