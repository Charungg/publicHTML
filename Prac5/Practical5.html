            <h2> Practical's Experience: </h2>
            <h3> <u> Positive </u> </h3>  
            <p> My experience with <em> CS11010 </em> is fairly positive. <br>
                The practical's worksheet was fairly challenging and well explained and structured, <br>
                it was clearly shown each worksheet was building on previously foundation. <br>
                Lecture was well explained and the example website helped me a lot <br>
                because I could analyse them and implement them to my websites. <br>
            </p>    

            <h3> <u> Negative </u> </h3>  
            <p> In my opinion the best way to learn HTML are practical worksheet <br>
                because they are designed for us students to tackle new concepts of HTML <br>
                whereas lectures only gives us an idea how it works which is why I think <br>
                instead of one practical worksheet it should be two a fortnight in place of lectures. <br>
                <br>
                Another problem I had was practical's and lectures not being linked, for example early <br>
                on lectures about CSS also had CSS specific practical worksheet given on the same week. <br>
                Whereas later on we was given JavaScript worksheets which was taught in previous weeks. <br>
            </p>  

            <h3> <u> What I Have Learnt </u> </h3>  
            <p> 
                I've learnt how to use HTML, Cascade Style Sheet and JavaScript of which <br>
                I found the most difficult because there is no compiler which indicates whenever <br>
                a syntax is invalid and when running the html will display no change or incorrect.
